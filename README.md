# ESP32-send-data-to-ThingSpeak
Send Hall Sensor Values to ThingSpeak using ESP32.
Can also be done on an ESP8266.

A basic project to get Hall Sensor readings from the ESP32 and write them to a channel on ThingSpeak. Instead of Hall Sensor, other sensors could be used. This is just for an example.
For this project, the user will need to set up an account on ThingSpeak, create a new channel, set the field names, get the Channel ID as and the Write API Key.

Software Requirements :
* Arduino IDE

Libraries required for this project are :
* ThingSpeak
* WiFi

These libraries can be downloaded using Arduino Library Manager.
